## Overview

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project focused on COVID-19 data. The analysis examines global trends in total cases and new cases, with a specific focus on comparing trends in India and the United States. The project utilizes Python, along with the pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn libraries for data manipulation and visualization.

## Data Source

The data for this analysis is sourced from the [Our World in Data](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data) COVID-19 dataset, which is regularly updated and publicly available.

## Project Structure

* This Notebook contains the complete code for the data analysis and visualizations. It includes the following:
    *   Data loading and preprocessing.
    *   Exploratory data analysis (EDA).
    *   Visualization of total cases over time for India and the United States.
    *   Visualization of daily new cases in India for the last 30 days.
    * Data Cleaning.
*   `README.md`: The file you're currently reading, which provides an overview of the project.

## Libraries Used

*   **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
*   **matplotlib**: For creating static visualizations.
*   **seaborn**: For creating enhanced statistical visualizations.
*   **NumPy**: For numerical operations.

## Key Analysis and Visualizations

1.  **Total Cases Over Time:**
    *   A line plot comparing the total COVID-19 cases over time for India and the United States. This helps visualize the overall trajectory of the pandemic in these two countries.

2.  **Daily New Cases in India (Last 30 Days):**
    *   A bar plot showing the daily new COVID-19 cases in India for the most recent 30 days. This highlights the recent trends in new case numbers.

## How to Use

1.  Clone this repository to your local machine
2.  Open the `covid_analysis.ipynb` notebook in a Jupyter environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, or Google Colab).
3.  Run the cells in the notebook sequentially to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.

## Further Development

Future enhancements planned for this project include:

*   Adding more countries to the comparison.
*   Incorporating additional features from the dataset, such as deaths, hospitalizations, and vaccinations.
*   Adding more statistical tests to compare trends between countries.
* Creating more complex visualizations.
